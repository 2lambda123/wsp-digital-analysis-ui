# Cycling Level of Traffic Stress LTS

## Analyzing LTS

When analyzing access by cycling, you may want to limit use of streets that most riders would consider dangerous or stressful. Different researchers have proposed various ways of quantifying stress for cyclists:

* [Level of Traffic Stress](http://transweb.sjsu.edu/research/low-stress-bicycling-and-network-connectivity) (LTS), developed by researchers at the Mineta Transportation Institute
* [Surrogate LTS](https://blog.conveyal.com/better-measures-of-bike-accessibility-d875ae5ed831), developed by Conveyal for contexts where no data beyond OpenStreetMap (OSM) are available

When cycling is enabled in Conveyal Analysis, varying the Max Level of Traffic Stress limit can provide insights into gaps in a regionâ€™s cycling infrastructure. Setting Max LTS to 1 in an analysis will allow cycling only on separated bicycle infrastructure or low-traffic streets; routing will revert to walking when traversing any links with LTS exceeding 1. Setting Max LTS to 3 in an analysis will allow cycling on links with LTS 1, 2, or 3. Differences in access between these two analyses may highlight places where new dedicated cycling infrastructure could improve access for cyclists with lower tolerances for stressful conditions.

## Labeling Network Edges with LTS

### Conveyal Surrogate LTS

Conveyal Surrogate LTS is the default methodology in Conveyal Analysis for assigning LTS values to network links based on commonly tagged attributes of OSM ways. The logic for assigning LTS values to OSM ways in v5.9.0 of the routing engine can be viewed in its [source code](https://github.com/conveyal/analysis-backend/blob/v5.9.0/src/main/java/com/conveyal/r5/labeling/LevelOfTrafficStressLabeler.java) and is summarized below:
* If way has highway=service tag, no LTS is assigned
* If way does not allow cars or has a highway=residential or highway=living_street tag, assign LTS 1
* If speed limit is less than 25 mph (40.25 kph) and the number of lanes is less than 4 or unspecified, assign LTS 2
* If way has tag highway=unclassified, highway=tertiary, or highway=tertiary-link and the number of lanes is less than 4 or there is cycleway tag for the correct direction, assign LTS 2
* Otherwise, if there is a cycleway tag for the correct direction, assign LTS 3
* Otherwise, assign LTS 4

Signalized intersections do not affect surrogate LTS. At unsignalized intersections, the highest LTS of any street link entering or exiting the intersection is assigned to all street links entering or exiting the intersection.

### Custom LTS

To override the default method described above, you can pre-process OSM before uploading it to Conveyal. Add the tag "LTS=" to ways, with numeric values 1-4.
