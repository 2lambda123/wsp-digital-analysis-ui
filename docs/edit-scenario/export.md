# Exporting modifications

You can generate a report summarizing all of the modifications you have made to a network, for printing or reference. To access the report, click <i class="fa fa-print" style="color:blue"></i> Print report next to the name of a project, then you will be able to choose which scenario to export. Keep in mind that some browsers may not print more than 30 pages or so of a very long report.
