# Exporting modifications

In editing mode, at the top of the panel next to the project name, there are multiple options for exporting your modifications.

Modifications in a scenario can be downloaded as a `.json` file by clicking <span class="ui-icon"><i class="fa fa-download"></i> Export project</span>.

You can also generate reports summarizing all modifications in a scenario, for printing or reference. To access these reports, click <span class="ui-icon"><i class="fa fa-print"></i>Print project</span>. Keep in mind that some browsers may not print more than 30 pages or so of a long report.
