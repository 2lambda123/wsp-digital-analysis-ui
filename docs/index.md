# Conveyal Analysis

This is [Conveyal](http://conveyal.com)'s tool for creating, editing and analyzing future public transport scenarios.

To use it, you'll first have to [prepare data inputs](prepare-inputs). Once you've done that, you can [create your scenario](edit-scenario).
Finally, you can use your scenario in [accessibility analysis](analysis), or export a [report](report) summarizing all the modifications
you have made.

You can also [export](export) your scenario to Transport Analyst. This is currently necessary for very large metropolitan regions;
smaller regions may be analyzed directly in Conveyal Analysis. Support for built-in analysis of larger regions is coming soon.
This exported file is also useful if you are a developer wanting to use a scenario in R5 directly.
