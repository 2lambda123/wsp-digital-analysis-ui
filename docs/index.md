# Scenario Editor

Scenario Editor is a [Conveyal](http://conveyal.com) tool for creating and editing future public transport scenarios. There
are plans to extend it to modes beyond public transport, and to allow the creation of land-use scenarios.

To use it, you'll first have to [prepare data inputs](prepare-inputs). Once you've done that, you can [create your scenario](edit-scenario),
and [export](export) it to Transport Analyst to use it for accessibility analysis.
