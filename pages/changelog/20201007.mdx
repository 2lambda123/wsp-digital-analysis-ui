## Worker version v6.0.0

The new recommended routing engine version enables a few new features:

- Decay functions
- Regional analyses can handle grids with different extents
- Single point analysis now uses more consistent methods with regional analyses.

> Routing engines v4 and v5 are still available for use, but do not include these new features.

### Distance decay functions

Conveyal Analysis can now apply distance decay functions rather than hard cutoffs in both regional and single-point analyses.

Rather than being the sum of all opportunities that can be reached in less than a specified number of minutes, the accessibility indicator can be more generally defined as the sum of all opportunities in the region, with each opportunity weighted (multiplied) by the value of a "decay function". It is now possible to select logistic (sigmoid), linear, and exponential decay functions in addition to the existing default step function.

### Routing engine bug fix

Routing engine v6 fixes a bug that increased waiting times for certain transfers, specifically those from schedule-based routes to frequency-based routes. This underestimated the benefits of certain added/modified routes. When transferring from schedule-based routes (e.g. from baseline GTFS) to routes specified by add-trip or adjust-frequency modifications with exact times disabled, correct waiting times were under-sampled, and longer waiting times were over-sampled, biasing results toward longer total travel times. Note that this bug did not affect transfers from frequency-based routes to schedule-based routes, between two scheduled routes, or between two frequency-based routes.
