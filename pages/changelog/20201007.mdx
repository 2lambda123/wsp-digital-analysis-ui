The new recommended routing engine version, v6.0.0, enables a few new features:

- Decay functions
- Regional analyses can handle grids with different extents
- Single point analysis now uses more consistent methods with regional analyses.

_Routing engines v4 and v5 are still available for use, but do not include these new features._

#### Distance decay functions

Conveyal Analysis can now apply distance decay functions rather than hard cutoffs in both regional and single-point analyses.

Rather than being the sum of all opportunities that can be reached in less than a specified number of minutes, the accessibility indicator can be more generally defined as the sum of all opportunities in the region, with each opportunity weighted (multiplied) by the value of a "decay function". This function always returns values between zero and one, and is a monotonically decreasing function of travel time. Put differently, the longer it takes to reach each opportunity the less it counts, eventually tapering down to zero. Simple cumulative opportunities accessibility is then a special case of this general definition where the weighting function has value 1 for all travel times less than the threshold, and value 0 for all travel times at or above the threshold.

#### Routing engine bug fix

Routing engine v6 fixes a bug that increased waiting times for certain transfers, specifically those from schedule-based routes to frequency-based routes. This underestimated the benefits of certain added/modified routes. More details: when transferring from schedule-based routes (e.g. from baseline GTFS) to routes specified by add-trip or adjust-frequency modifications with exact times disabled, correct waiting times were under-sampled, and longer waiting times were over-sampled, biasing results toward longer total travel times. Note that this bug did not affect transfers from frequency-based routes to schedule-based routes, between two scheduled routes, or between two frequency-based routes.

#### Fresh user manual

The latest version of the Conveyal user manual is now at docs.conveyal.com. It's quite a bit faster and better looking than before.

#### Bookmarks are now Presets

We've created the ability to rename and delete presets. We also clarified the logic for saving analysis settings.

#### Travel time distribution in single origin analysis

If you hover over a travel time isochrone you will see the travel time distribution from the origin to your cursor updated while you are moving. You can also now select a specific destination to pin and move the origin or fetch new results to see changes in the travel time to that point.
