#### Distance decay functions

TODO ...
- The new recommended routing engine version, v6.0.0, enables a few new features:
  - Decay functions
  - Regional analyses can handle grids with different extents
  - Single point analysis now uses more consistent methods with regional analyses.
- Routing engines v4 and v5 are still available for use, but do not include these new features.

#### Routing engine bug fix

- Routing engine v6 also fixes a bug that increased waiting times for certain transfers, specifically those from schedule-based routes to frequency-based routes. This underestimated the benefits of certain added/modified routes. More details: when transferring from schedule-based routes (e.g. from baseline GTFS) to routes specified by add-trip or adjust-frequency modifications with exact times disabled, correct waiting times were under-sampled, and longer waiting times were over-sampled, biasing results toward longer total travel times. Note that this bug did not affect transfers from frequency-based routes to schedule-based routes, between two scheduled routes, or between two frequency-based routes.

#### Fresh user manual
- The latest version of the Conveyal user manual is now at docs.conveyal.com.

#### Bookmarks are now Presets

- The logic for saving analysis settings has been clarified, and you now have the option to rename or delete presets.

#### Travel time distribution in Single Origin Analysis

TODO ... (it's pretty)
