#### Multi-dimensional regional analyses

Previously, each regional analysis ran with a single specific opportunity dataset, time cutoff, and percentile. This required multiple analyses to be run even when the underlying network bundle, scenario, and analysis settings were the same.

We now added the ability to create a single regional analysis that can be run with multiple opportunity datasets, time cutoffs, and travel time percentiles.

Along with creating multi-dimensional regional analyses we've overhauled the regional analysis page to easily allow comparing a single analysis with itself across these new dimensions.

Additionally, added an expanded look at the exact settings used to create each analysis and an easy way to export that data as JSON.
