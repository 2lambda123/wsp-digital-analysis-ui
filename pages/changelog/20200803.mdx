#### Multi-dimensional regional analyses

**Worker version v5.10.0 and higher is required.**

Previously, each regional analysis ran with a single specific opportunity dataset, time cutoff, and percentile. This required multiple analyses to be run even when the underlying network bundle, scenario, and analysis settings were the same.

We now added the ability to create a single regional analysis that can be run with multiple opportunity datasets, time cutoffs, and travel time percentiles.

Along with creating multi-dimensional regional analyses we've overhauled the regional analysis page to easily allow comparing a single analysis with itself across these new dimensions.

Additionally, we added the way to look at the exact settings used to create each analysis and an easy way to export that data as JSON.

#### Modifications view

We also restyled the modifications list and scenario view. We made it more compact to prevent needing to collapse the individual sections of modification types.

We also added an inline text editor for editing the names of modifications, scenarios, and regional analyses. If you can't find the "pencil" icon we used previously, try hovering and clicking the name in order to edit it.
