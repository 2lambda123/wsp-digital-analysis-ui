#### Comparison specific settings for single-point analyses

We revamped the single-point analysis page and added the ability to configure settings specifically for your comparison analysis. This enables comparisons of scenarios on different dates, with specific transit modes taken out, maximum transfer differences and more!

Here is an example using the same scenario, but the comparison only has bus enabled.

#### Experimental Street Modifications -- **worker version v4.9.0 or higher required**

**Note**: features marked as "experimental" may be subject to changes in the near future. Development is ongoing and expectations for support if problems arise should be lower. That being said, they can be used.

We added two additional modifications for small scale street network changes. With an Add Streets modification, you can add a new pedestrian connection, bike path, car bridge, and more. With a Modify Streets modification you can model tunnel closures, slower speeds, and more.
